# Data Analysis of the most popular supermarket sales dataset on Kaggle

 data sourced from Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aungpyaeap/supermarket-sales

### Summary
Examining the various aspects of this very popular and most downloaded dataset on Kaggle, the conclusion that has been reached is that this dataset is not very good and most likely falsified/manually constructed and not based on real data. Analysis was desired on profitability and revenues however this is not possible.

Points that have considered to reach this conclusion:

1) Exactly 1000 sales entries for a 3 month sales period. Possible? yes but very unlikely
2) Gender split is near 50/50 on sales
3) Sales transactions is split roughly proportionate between the 3 branches
4) Gross margin percentage is the same for all product lines
5) Sales across all products lines are also roughly portionate
6) Payment methods across all products lines are also roughly portionate
7) Gross income for some reason is the same for all product lines
8) Gross Income for some reason equals 'tax of 5%' meaning profitability across all sales is zero. How is this possible?

Is the dataset useful in any sense? Probably only to practice data analysis techniques but not taken seriously.

The only redeeming aspect of the dataset is examining the time of purchases where it seems to follow some real life logic.
